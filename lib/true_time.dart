/// NTP client for Flutter. Calculate the date and time "now" impervious to manual changes to device clock time.

/// Users may do this for a variety of reasons, like being in different timezones, trying to be punctual by setting their clocks 5 â€“ 10 minutes early, etc. Your application or service may want a date that is unaffected by these changes and reliable as a source of truth. TrueTime gives you that.
